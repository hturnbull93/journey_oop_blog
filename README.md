# A Journey with OOP

This is a very small project to demonstrate the Object Oriented Programming principles of dependency injection, forwarding, and polymorphism in Ruby.

Read the [full blog post](https://medium.com/@hturnbull93/a-journey-with-oop-6cc7737a9e53) about it.

## Installation

Clone this repo to your local machine, and run `bundle`. This will install RSpec for you.

Run the tests by running `rspec` from the main directory.

Try commenting out the contents of the Walk and Car classes, the tests should still work, due to dependency injection.
